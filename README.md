# Breath2_Ripoff_Vim_Theme
This is a vim theme (color scheme) based on the Breath2 theme that comes default with KDE Plasma Manjaro

Make sure you have this added to your `.vimrc` for the true colors of the theme.
```vim
if has('termguicolors')
  set termguicolors
endif
```

## Installation
1 Add the Breath2_Ripoff.vim file to your `~/.vim/colors` directory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 If the directory does not exist then create one

2 Add this line into your `.vimrc`
```vim
colorscheme Breath2_Ripoff
```

3 Finally do a good old `:source %` while in the vim editor.
